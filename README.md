Entropic Endeavors is an interactive text score composition. 

The audience uses their phone to pick words, and also to input new words.
These words are randomly picked and shown for the musician.
The audience also sees the words on screen. 

TODO: 
Maybe the words are fed through an algorithm that tries to associate the audience's words?
As the piece progress, the algorithm get more and more chaotic/entropic in its associations?


TODO:
Maybe use some kind of dictionary-like API to get related words, etc?
Like one of these:
